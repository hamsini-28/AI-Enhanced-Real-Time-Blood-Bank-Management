# 🩸 AI-Enhanced Real-Time Blood Bank Management System

An intelligent, full-stack web and mobile application designed to automate and optimize blood bank operations using Artificial Intelligence, real-time inventory tracking, and donor–recipient matching.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Blood availability is critical in healthcare emergencies. Traditional blood bank systems rely heavily on manual processes, leading to delays, errors, and poor coordination.

This project introduces a centralized, AI-powered Blood Bank Management System that connects donors, hospitals, and administrators through a single digital platform.
